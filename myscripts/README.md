# Hello, welcome to my scripts

Here is my collection of scripts that I've made to make my life easier.
Consisting of various startup scripts along with a wrapper around i3lock and swaylock
(because I don't want to install the fancy stuff...)

It also contains setup script for setting up:
* `zsh` - [setupmyzsh.sh](./setupmyzsh.sh)
* `vim` - [setupvim.sh](./setupvim.sh)
* `neovim` - [setupneovim.sh](./setupneovim.sh)
* A script for setting up a desktop from a selected few [setupdesktop.sh](./setupdesktop.sh)

There is also [setmeupv2.sh](./setmeupv2.sh) for setting up a simple archlinux environment with `zsh`,`vim` and `neovim`.

Most of these scripts are meant to be portable with the exception of `setmeupv2.sh` and `setupdesktop.sh` that only works for Archlinux
