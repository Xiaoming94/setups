# setup
New dotfiles and scripts Repo

* [./configs](./configs) contains all my configuration dotfiles
    * Most of these will be symlinked somewhere in '$HOME'
    * Note that this directory itself is not symlinked to only store necessary config files
* [./myscripts](./myscripts) contains all my custom scripts including my setup scripts

Feel free to explore I guess
